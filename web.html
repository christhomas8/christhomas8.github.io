		<h2>Chris Thomas</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Chris and I was born to code! My first introduction to programming came through Robotics as a Mechanical Engineer.
			From there, my curiousity to know how things worked lead me to developing other software applications.  
			This includes: Websites, User Interfaces, Mobile and Desktop apps, and more! 
			This portfolio is designed to grow with me in my career as an Engineer and Developer.
			Feel free to contact me through any of the platforms below!

			<h3>Clanora.com</h3>

			<p>Every year, groups of people participate in Secret Santa gift exchanges. This full-stack website,
				hosted at: <a href="https://www.clanora.com" target="_blank">clanora.com</a>, makes this process easy.
				Users can sign up by creating an account, or login if they already have an account. Users can modify
				their profiles, anytime they want. After a drawing takes place, group participants are assigned a unique 
				giftee (someone to get a gift for) and are set to receive a gift from another unique user in the group.
				The gifters can view their assigned person's interests and information to assist with getting a more 
				personalized and useful gift. Many other features are included in this site, such as sending emails to 
				users, event countdowns, and more!

			<h3>Workforce Management App</h3>
			<img src="images/loginpage.png">
			<img src="images/UI.png">
			<p> React is a popular open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. Using this framework,
				I developed a Workforce Management app for a call center UI demonstration. This app allows a user to login by communicating with a 
				Nodejs API (which I also developed) to validate the data. If the data passes authentication, the main UI of the app is rendered and 
				personalizes it with the user's data. This app includes other features like a randomly generated schedule, an interactive phone, a 
				note pad, and much more!

			<h3 style="color:black;">SpecialTSupport.com</h3>
			<img src="images/sts.png">
			<p>As a software creator, I enjoy solving problems with my programming skills. 
				To make myself available to businesses and individuals, I needed a place for my digital presence.
				I designed the website specialtsupport.com so that people who needed software solutions could find me.
				Since its creation, I have developed software for multiple business owners resulting in high customer satisfaction!

			<h3>Web App Game</h3>
			<img src="images/app.png">
			<p>Everyone loves games! Everyone also loves gifts!
				Motivated by this, I developed a personailzed Twister style Web App game.
				This SaaS can be used by uploading personal pictures, and pressing the spin button.
				The spinner stops randomly on a picture along with an instruction. 
				That is the command that needs to be followed. 
				The uploaded pictures also need to be printed and placed in a grid like pattern in the floor.
				Otherwise, this game can be played anywhere and altered to a person's preference (ex. Title).
				This includes game nights, special occassions, romantic dates, parties, or regular hangouts.

			<h3>Login Form</h3>
			<img src="images/login.png">
			<p>User accounts are common for making a profile unique and secure.
				For this purpose, I created a user login page that accesses a database, verifies that the user's credentials match, and alerts that the user is logged in.
				This is one of the earlier projects I did to learn and apply MySQL and PHP to websites.
