		<h2>Chris Thomas</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Chris and I was born to code! My first introduction to programming came through Robotics as a Mechanical Engineer.
			From there, my curiousity to know how things worked lead me to developing other software applications.  
			This includes: Websites, User Interfaces, Mobile and Desktop apps, and more! 
			This portfolio is designed to grow with me in my career as an Engineer and Developer.
			Feel free to contact me through any of the platforms below!

			<h3>Search and Rescue Simulator</h3>
			<img src="images/mas.gif">
			<p>Multiple Agent Systems (e.g. distributed robot systems) are great for simplifying complex tasks.
				For example, using multiple searching robots allows more ground to be covered in less time than a single robot.
				In order for this to be successful, the robots need to communicate with one another. 
				By doing this, the same ground is not searched repeatedly and more new ground is explored.
				I made a simualtor where robots are given an initial start location and an unknown target is randomly placed on the search space.
				During the search, the robots avoid obstacles, communicate their past search histories with one another, and search the space until the target is found.

			<h3>Telepresence Interface</h3>
			<img src="images/hmi.png">
			<p>Video sensors can lag randomly depending on the conditions of their environments.
				This is undesirable for mobile robot applications because it can cause crashes or slower performances.
				To overcome this uncontrollable occurance, I developed an human-machine interface.
				This interface combines video sensors (cameras) with distance sensors (LiDARs).
				As a result, the operators will always have a strong Telepresence of the environment he or she is operating in.
				Even when the video stream lags, they can still see how far they are from obstacles.

			<h3>Networked Systems Latency Controller</h3>
			<img src="images/asp.png">
			<p>Latency is found in all telecommunication systems.
				The latency found in networks like the Internet varies and cannot be predicted beforehand.
				Latency in networked systems can cause instability and unpredictable effects to occur.
				To prevent these negative effects from happening, I developed an adaptive latency controller.
				This controller estimates the delay in the network in real-time and adapts itself to handle the delay present at that time for a more stable performance.
				This can be applied to teleoperation, robotics, distributed computing, and much more!

			<h3>Autonomous Robot Searching</h3>
			<img src="images/slam1.png">
			<p>Knowing the layout of the land is very beneficial when planning and carrying out operations.
				Things such as natural disaster stricken regions, underground caves, and uncharted areas make it harder to be prepared due to the new or modified environment.
				Using a robot to search and gather information on an environment can be extremely helpful in these situations.
				To make this happen, I developed controllers and combined them with distance detectors (LiDARs).
				The end result enabled robots to navigate and map an environment autonomously.
