		<h2>Chris Thomas</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Chris and I was born to code! My first introduction to programming came through Robotics as a Mechanical Engineer.
			From there, my curiousity to know how things worked lead me to developing other software applications.  
			This includes: Websites, User Interfaces, Mobile and Desktop apps, and more! 
			This portfolio is designed to grow with me in my careeras an Engineer and Developer.
			Feel free to contact me through any of the platforms below!

			<h3>TripVision Mobile App</h3>
			<img src="images/TripVision.png" >

			<p>
				Noregon Systems is a software company that offers diagnostic and repair solutions to top fleets and service centers 
				to keep commercial trucks and equipment rolling. They have a web application called "TripVision" which monitors 
				entire fleets of medium and heavy-duty vehicles from a single application. TripVision provides insights into all 
				vehicles and all major components to help detect health, safety, or performance related issues as soon 
				as â€” or in some cases, before they happen. I placed all of the same functionality from the web application into a 
				mobile app for more convenience to fleet managers. For cross platform functionality and simpler maintenance, it 
				was built with MAUI. It also includes other items specific to each platform. The Android version is published on the 
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noregon.tripVision&hl=en_US" target="_blank">
					Google Play Store</a> and the iOS version is published on the 
				<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tripvision/id1260751005?platform=iphone" target="_blank">App Store</a>.

			<h3>Car Driving Game</h3>
			<img src="images/driving_game.png"> 
			<p>
				Game development provides a great way to display multidisciplinary programming skills.
				It combines efficient coding, graphics control, hardware performance, debugging, scripting, mathematics and game logic.
				To highlight some of my skills in these areas, I made a Car Driving Game.
				This game is made entirely from scratch with C++, custom sprites, user input control, and smooth gameplay mechanics. 
				The source code for this project is located here: <a href="https://github.com/christhomas8/car-driving-game" style="text-decoration: none;">Car-Driving-Game</a>.

			<h3>Slot Machine</h3>
			<img src="images/casino_slots.png"> 
			<p>
				Casinos are one of the biggest forms of entertainment to people around the world.  
				They commonly host a popular game of chance known as Slots.
				For this reason, I developed a Slot Machine to bring that same joy to others.
				It works by receiving lever input from a user, randomly spins each slot, and reveals results.
				Also, a QR code scan system was put in place to allow logging in to profiles and access to stored data. 
				The source code for this project is located here: <a href="https://github.com/christhomas8/casino" style="text-decoration: none;">Casino Slots</a>.

			<h3>Customer Address Book</h3>
			<img src="images/cab.png">
			<p>
				All businesses rely on the supply and demand principle.
				However, customer demand varies from region to region.
				For a salesperson to market properly and efficiently, he or she needs to navigate potential customers based on regions.
				For this purpose, I developed a desktop app in Visual Studio. 
				This Microsoft based app communicates with SQL servers and databases to search for customers by regions. 
				It also allows for adding, modifying, or deleting customers from repositories.

			<h3>Binary Database</h3>
			<img src="images/database.png">
			<p>
				The knowledge of storing data is often passed to third parties for most individuals.
				Therefore, I created my own database from scratch using one of the most universal languages.
				The purpose of this project was to learn and teach others how to store and access data. 
				It stores information in a binary format which increases the difficulty for others or outsiders to inspect it. 
				It runs from the command line and works great for keeping inventory!

			<h3>Artificial Neural Network</h3>
			<img src="images/offenders.png">
			<p>Law enforcement has a limited amount of resources. 
				Therefore, managing the resources properly is always necessary.
				Using a large amount of data from the FBI crime reports, I was able to create an artificial neural network.
				This neural network predicts the location, time of day, and sex of an offender.
				This is useful because it allows police departments to allocate their resources more efficiently.
				For example, where and how many officers should patrol a location or how many should respond to a call.

			<h3>Genesis Mobile App</h3>
			<img src="images/genesis.jpg">
			<p>Mobile apps are increasing in popularity due to the convenience of cell phones.
				To adapt to this increasing demand, I developed an Android app.
				Since the main focus of this app was learning, it primarily focuses on navigation through information placed in the app.
				I even deployed it to a phone to test out the entire process.
				Although this is an ongoing project, the latest version can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/christhomas8/genesis-app" style="text-decoration: none;">Genesis-App</a>.
