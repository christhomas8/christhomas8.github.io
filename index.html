		<h2>Chris Thomas</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Chris and I was born to code! My first introduction to programming came through Robotics as a Mechanical Engineer.
			From there, my curiousity to know how things worked lead me to developing other software applications.  
			This includes: Websites, User Interfaces, Mobile and Desktop apps, and more! 
			This portfolio is designed to grow with me in my career as a Full Stack Developer.
			Feel free to contact me through any of the platforms below!

			<img src="images/sts.png">
			<p>As a software creator, I enjoy solving problems with my programming skills. 
				To make myself available to businesses and individuals, I needed a place for my digital presence.
				I designed the website specialtsupport.com so that people who needed software solutions could find me.
				Since its creation, I have developed software for multiple business owners resulting in high customer satisfaction!

			<h3>Customer Address Book</h3>
			<img src="images/cab.png">
			<p>
				All businesses rely on the supply and demand principle.
				However, customer demand varies from region to region.
				For a salesperson to market properly and efficiently, he or she needs to navigate potential customers based on regions.
				For this purpose, I developed a desktop app in Visual Studio. 
				This Microsoft based app communicates with SQL servers and databases to search for customers by regions. 
				It also allows for adding, modifying, or deleting customers from repositories.

			<h3>Web App Game</h3>
			<img src="images/app.png">
			<p>Everyone loves games! Everyone also loves gifts!
				Motivated by this, I developed a personailzed Twister style Web App game.
				This SaaS can be used by uploading personal pictures, and pressing the spin button.
				The spinner stops randomly on a picture along with an instruction. 
				That is the command that needs to be followed. 
				The uploaded pictures also need to be printed and placed in a grid like pattern in the floor.
				Otherwise, this game can be played anywhere and altered to a person's preference (ex. Title).
				This includes game nights, special occassions, romantic dates, parties, or regular hangouts.

			<h3>Binary Database</h3>
			<img src="images/database.png">
			<p>
				The knowledge of storing data is often passed to third parties for most individuals.
				Therefore, I created my own database from scratch using one of the most universal languages.
				The purpose of this project was to learn and teach others how to store and access data. 
				It stores information in a binary format which increases the difficulty for others or outsiders to inspect it. 
				It runs from the command line and works great for keeping inventory!

			<h3>Artificial Neural Network</h3>
			<img src="images/offenders.png">
			<p>Law enforcement has a limited amount of resources. 
				Therefore, managing the resources properly is always necessary.
				Using a large amount of data from the FBI crime reports, I was able to create an artificial neural network.
				This neural network predicts the location, time of day, and sex of an offender.
				This is useful because it allows police departments to allocate their resources more efficiently.
				For example, where and how many officers should patrol a location or how many should respond to a call.

			<h3>Login Form</h3>
			<img src="images/login.png">
			<p>User accounts are common for making a profile unique and secure.
				For this purpose, I created a user login page that accesses a database, verifies that the user's credentials match, and alerts that the user is logged in.
				This is one of the earlier projects I did to learn and apply MySQL and PHP to websites.

			<h3>Genesis Mobile App</h3>
			<img src="images/genesis.jpg">
			<p>Mobile apps are increasing in popularity due to the convenience of cell phones.
				To adapt to this increasing demand, I developed an Android app.
				Since the main focus of this app was learning, it primarily focuses on navigation through information placed in the app.
				I even deployed it to a phone to test out the entire process.
				Although this is an ongoing project, the latest version can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/christhomas8/genesis-app" style="text-decoration: none;">Genesis-App</a>.

			<h3>Search and Rescue Simulator</h3>
			<img src="images/mas.gif">
			<p>Multiple Agent Systems (e.g. distributed robot systems) are great for simplifying complex tasks.
				For example, using multiple searching robots allows more ground to be covered in less time than a single robot.
				In order for this to be successful, the robots need to communicate with one another. 
				By doing this, the same ground is not searched repeatedly and more new ground is explored.
				I made a simualtor where robots are given an initial start location and an unknown target is randomly placed on the search space.
				During the search, the robots avoid obstacles, communicate their past search histories with one another, and search the space until the target is found.

			<h3>Telepresence Interface</h3>
			<img src="images/hmi.png">
			<p>Video sensors can lag randomly depending on the conditions of their environments.
				This is undesirable for mobile robot applications because it can cause crashes or slower performances.
				To overcome this uncontrollable occurance, I developed an human-machine interface.
				This interface combines video sensors (cameras) with distance sensors (LiDARs).
				As a result, the operators will always have a strong Telepresence of the environment he or she is operating in.
				Even when the video stream lags, they can still see how far they are from obstacles.

			<h3>Networked Systems Latency Controller</h3>
			<img src="images/asp.png">
			<p>Latency is found in all telecommunication systems.
				The latency found in networks like the Internet varies and cannot be predicted beforehand.
				Latency in networked systems can cause instability and unpredictable effects to occur.
				To prevent these negative effects from happening, I developed an adaptive latency controller.
				This controller estimates the delay in the network in real-time and adapts itself to handle the delay present at that time for a more stable performance.
				This can be applied to teleoperation, robotics, distributed computing, and much more!

			<h3>Autonomous Robot Searching</h3>
			<img src="images/slam1.png">
			<p>Knowing the layout of the land is very beneficial when planning and carrying out operations.
				Things such as natural disaster stricken regions, underground caves, and uncharted areas make it harder to be prepared due to the new or modified environment.
				Using a robot to search and gather information on an environment can be extremely helpful in these situations.
				To make this happen, I developed controllers and combined them with distance detectors (LiDARs).
				The end result enabled robots to navigate and map an environment autonomously.
